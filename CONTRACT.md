# Forge contract (frozen)

Shared by every component. Python types live in `forge/types.py`, the database in `forge/schema.sql`.
Change any of these only with a note in this file and updates to every implementer.

## Conventions

- IDs: prefixed random hex, `ag_`, `v_`, `r_`, `fb_`, `ec_`, `im_` + 12 hex chars.
- Times: unix seconds as float.
- Model strings: `anthropic:<model-id>` or `openai_compat:<base_url>|<model>`, e.g. `openai_compat:http://localhost:11434/v1|qwen3:8b`.
- Data directory: `$FORGE_DATA_DIR` (default `./data`): `forge.db`, `runs/<run_id>/workspace.tar.gz`, `runs/<run_id>/diff.patch`.
- Secrets are redacted in event payloads by replacing each secret value with `[REDACTED]` before `emit`.
- Default models: `$FORGE_DEFAULT_MODEL` for agents, `$FORGE_GRADER_MODEL` for judge and optimizer.

## HTTP API (prefix `/v1`)

Auth for runtime endpoints: `Authorization: Bearer <api_key>` or `?share=<share_token>` (also header `X-Share-Token`).
Builder endpoints are unauthenticated (local builder). Errors: `{"detail": "<message>"}` with a 4xx/5xx status.

### Builder

| Method | Path | Body | Returns |
|---|---|---|---|
| POST | `/agents` | `{slug, name, description?, system_prompt, model?, tools?, network?, seed_files?, auto_promote?}` | `Agent` + `"api_key"` (shown once) |
| GET | `/agents` | | `[Agent]` |
| GET | `/agents/{slug}` | | `Agent` with `versions` |
| PATCH | `/agents/{slug}` | `{name?, description?, auto_promote?, eval_repeats?: 1..9}` | `Agent` |
| POST | `/agents/{slug}/versions` | `{system_prompt?, lessons?, model?, tools?, network?, seed_files?, rationale?}` (unset fields copied from prod) | `Version` |
| GET | `/agents/{slug}/versions/{n or "prod"}` | | `Version` |
| POST | `/agents/{slug}/promote` | `{version: n}` | `Agent` |
| PUT | `/agents/{slug}/secrets` | `{NAME: value, ...}` | `{"names": [..]}` |
| POST | `/agents/{slug}/rotate-key` | | `{"api_key": ".."}` |
| GET | `/templates` | | `[{key, name, description, system_prompt, tools, network}]` |

### Runtime (API key or share token)

| Method | Path | Body | Returns |
|---|---|---|---|
| POST | `/agents/{slug}/runs` | JSON `{input, version?, wait?, callback_url?, seed_files?}` or multipart `input`, `version?`, `wait?`, `callback_url?`, `files` (each file placed at its filename; a single `.tar.gz` is extracted) | `Run` (final if `wait=true`) |
| GET | `/agents/{slug}/runs?limit=50` | | `[Run]` newest first |
| GET | `/runs/{id}` | | `Run` |
| GET | `/runs/{id}/events?after=<seq>` | | SSE stream: each message `event: <type>`, `id: <seq>`, `data: <Event JSON>`; ends with `event: end` after `run_finished` |
| GET | `/runs/{id}/events.json` | | `[Event]` |
| GET | `/runs/{id}/artifacts` | | `application/gzip` |
| GET | `/runs/{id}/diff` | | `text/plain` |
| POST | `/runs/{id}/feedback` | `{rating: 1 or -1, comment?}` | `Feedback` |

Builder UI calls runtime endpoints without auth when the request comes from localhost.

Auth amendments (server implementation):
- Builder routes require a localhost client or that agent's API key; `GET/POST /agents` are localhost only; `/templates` is open; `FORGE_TRUST_ALL=1` disables checks.
- A share token may `GET /agents/{slug}` and its versions (for the share page) and start/read its own share runs; it gets 401 on builder, eval and improve routes. With a share token, `GET /agents/{slug}/runs` lists only share-sourced runs.
- Share page URL: `/s/{slug}?share=<token>`.
- Extras: Run includes `eval_case_id`; eval results include `"running": bool`; `PUT secrets` with an empty value deletes it.

### Improvement

| Method | Path | Body | Returns |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/agents/{slug}/evals` | | `[EvalCase]` |
| POST | `/agents/{slug}/evals` | `{name, input, seed_files?, checker_type, checker, split}` | `EvalCase` |
| DELETE | `/evals/{id}` | | `{"ok": true}` |
| POST | `/runs/{id}/save-as-eval` | `{name?, checker_type?, checker?, split?}` (default judge rubric from feedback comment) | `EvalCase` |
| POST | `/agents/{slug}/evals/run` | `{version?: n}` | `{"version": n, "results": [...]}` runs (cached) eval of one version, async; poll via GET below |
| GET | `/agents/{slug}/evals/results?version=n` | | `{"version": n, "train": {...}, "holdout": {...}, "repeats": k, "results": [{case_id, passed, reason, run_id, passes, runs}]}` |
| POST | `/agents/{slug}/improve` | `{}` | `Improvement` (status `running`; poll) |
| GET | `/improvements/{id}` | | `Improvement` |
| GET | `/agents/{slug}/improvements` | | `[Improvement]` newest first |

### Local runner

| Method | Path | Body | Returns |
|---|---|---|---|
| POST | `/runs` | `{agent_slug, version_n, input, source: "local"}` | `Run` (status `running`) |
| POST | `/runs/{id}/events` | `[Event]` | `{"ok": true}` (a `run_finished` event finalizes the run) |

## Repeated evals (amendment)

Each eval case runs `k` times per version, `k` = the agent's `eval_repeats` (PATCH, 1..9); unset agents use
`$FORGE_EVAL_REPEATS`, else 3. A case **passes for a version iff a strict majority of its k runs pass**
(`2 * passes > k`; for even k a tie fails). Per-run verdicts are stored in `eval_run_results`; `eval_results`
is the per-case summary with `passes`, `runs` (= k) and a representative `run_id`/`reason`: the first failing
run when the case failed, else the first passing run. Summaries are cached per version: a case whose summary
already covers k runs is not re-run, and changing k reuses stored runs and only adds missing ones. A run whose
checker never ran (infrastructure error) is not stored and is retried on the next evaluation. At most 4 eval
sandbox runs execute at once across all cases and repeats. Eval result and Improvement case objects gain
`passes` and `runs` (additive); `passed` is the majority verdict.

## Stop reasons and prompt caching (amendment)

`ModelResponse` gains `stop_reason` (`end_turn`, `tool_use`, `max_tokens`, `refusal`, ...; OpenAI-compatible
`finish_reason` is mapped: `length` -> `max_tokens`, `content_filter` -> `refusal`, `stop` -> `end_turn`,
`tool_calls` -> `tool_use`), `stop_detail` (refusal category, else its explanation), `cache_read_tokens` and
`cache_write_tokens`. In `run_agent`: a `refusal` turn fails the run with an `error` event
`Model declined: <detail>` and none of its tool calls run; a `max_tokens` turn without tool calls fails the run
(the truncated text is never the final answer); a `max_tokens` turn with tool calls runs all but the last call,
which gets an error result because its arguments may be cut off. `AnthropicProvider` sets `cache_control`
(ephemeral) on the system block, which caches tools + system, and in tool-using calls on the last message block,
which caches the growing conversation (2 of 4 breakpoints). `run_finished` payloads and Run objects carry
`cache_read_tokens` and `cache_write_tokens`; `tokens_in` stays the uncached input count.

## Promotion rule

Candidate eligible iff `candidate_passed_total > base_passed_total` and no case passed by base fails for candidate,
where "passed" is the per-case majority verdict above.
`auto_promote` agents: eligible candidates are promoted automatically; an improvement cycle also starts when 3 new
negative feedback items arrive since the last improvement.
